# Public Speed Reviews App

My first attempt at making a rails application with reactJS frontend, followed a guide here: https://youtu.be/L3u0L67m-oc.
App allows user to log their internet speeds at their current location to track public / private speeds. 

* Rails 7 with ReactJS.

* PostgreSQL for database.

* Requires jsbundling gem, esbuild, and react-internet-meter.
